        olive oil and lemon juice, garnish with scallion greens, and enjoy for lunch or dinner. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can vegetable stock </li>
        <li>7 ounces red lentils, picked over and rinsed </li>
        <li>1 cup minced fresh parsley </li>
        <li>½ cup minced fresh mint </li>
        <li>2 medium chopped green onions, white and green parts separated </li>
        <li>2 medium Roma tomatoes, seeded, diced </li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced </li>
        <li>salt to taste (optional) </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring vegetable stock to a boil in a saucepan and add drained lentils. Stir and reduce to a simmer.
            Simmer uncovered, for 7 to 8 minutes. Lentils will be slightly undercooked. Drain, and allow to cool,
            about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place cooled lentils in a large mixing bowl and add minced fresh parsley and mint. Add white parts of
            the green onions, reserving the chopped greens for the garnish. Add tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Combine extra-virgin olive oil and zest and juice of a lemon in a small bowl. Stir to combine, then pour
            over the salad and toss. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, before serving.</li>
        <li>Before serving, taste and add salt, if desired. Garnish with reserved chopped green tops of green
            onions.</li>
    </ol>
